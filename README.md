# Easytodt
Easytodt is basically just an extension of the pre-existing RuneLite Wintertodt plugin.  
All I did was add sound alerts when interrupted or low health.

I have no clue as to whether or not this is against OSRS TOS, but it's unlikely to get you banned as it functions identically to the original plugin.
